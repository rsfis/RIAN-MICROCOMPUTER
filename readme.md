## PCB
The PCBs were made using KiCad. One board for general purpose components and another for the keyboard.

These 2 PCBs will fit perfectly on top of each other using pins headers and pin sockets.

## OS and APPS
The OS is the RazorOS, made using ArduinoIDE, LovyanGFX and LUA Interpreter.

The OS itself is programmed in C++ using Arduino IDE, with own firmware. The OS has:
- Home Page with a Desktop area
- Control Panel for Rapid Settings
- Users
- Clock
- Settings
- Task Manager
- Notifications
- Watchdog
- Terminal in LUA

The apps are made in LUA. Apps will create a LUA Virtual Machine to execute the code directly in the processor using various C++ External Functions. 

Using the Text Editor, you will also be able to create your own apps to Razor32 and control everything.

Planned Apps:
- Internet Browser Based on Text (Lynx)
- File Sender

- Text Editor
- Calculator
- To-do
- Calendar
- PDF Viewer
- Excel Like

- Tetris
- Snake

- Scanner Wifi
- Terminal Serial
- Packet Logger

OS and Firmware are still being programmed. Soon, I will have more informations about it.
